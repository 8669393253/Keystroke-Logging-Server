# Keystroke-Logging-Server
This repository contains a Flask-based web server for capturing and storing keystroke data sent from a client application. The data is stored both in memory (for short-term retrieval) and in a SQLite database (for persistent storage). This project also includes functionality to retrieve stored logs via a GET endpoint.
